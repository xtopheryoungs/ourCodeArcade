# Hello, World!

## Step 1

One of the first things to do when learning a programming language is to write "Hello, world!", a simple program that prints "Hello, world!" on the screen.  The point of "Hello, World!" is to get familiar with the programming environment and to ensure that code can at least run.  

Press the button with the light bulb icon below to see a hint.

This is the Hint area.  Some tutorial pages will provide a hint here about what to do.

Press the Next button to turn to the next page in the tutorial.

## Step 2

This area you're reading right now is the tutorial page which provides instructions on what to do.  

The large gray area on the right side of the CodeBuilder window is the workspace where you can place code blocks to create your program.

To the left of the workspace is the toolbox, which has categories or drawers of different code blocks that you can drag into the workspace.

#### ~ tutorialhint

You can remove a block from the workspace by dragging it into the toolbox.  Alternatively, you can select a block in the workspace and press Delete on your keyboard.

Try deleting the ``||player:on chat command||`` block.  

## Step 3

In the lower right corner of the workspace are several buttons.  The large green button is the Play button which will close the CodeBuilder window and run your code.

The + and - buttons control the zoom level of the workspace, though they may not appear if the CodeBuilder window is too small.

The arrow buttons undo and redo actions performed in the workspace.  Try using the Undo button to bring back the block you deleted earlier; press the Redo button to remove it once more.

On the edge of the CodeBuilder window are an X button and a menu button.  

Pressing the X button (or Esc on your keyboard) closes the CodeBuilder window.  

The menu contains buttons that can change the size of the CodeBuilder window and swap which side of the screen it appears on.

## Step 4

Drag a ``||player:say||`` block into the ``||loops:on start||`` block and change the text inside it to say "Hello, World!"

Press the Play button to run your code.

#### ~ tutorialhint

When you press the Play button, the ``||loops:on start||`` block will run the code inside it, causing "Hello, World!" to appear in the chat in Minecraft.

```blocks
player.say("Hello, World!")
```

```ghost
player.say("Hello, World!")
```
